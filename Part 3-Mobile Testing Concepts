# QA-Lead-Assessment-Rubini Part 3 answers

1. How you would approach testing a mobile application on both iOS and
Android? 
✅ 1. Define Test Strategy/Test plan
a. Understand Requirements
Functional requirements (features, flows)

Non-functional (performance, security, UI responsiveness)

b. Decide Testing Types
Unit Testing

UI Testing

Integration Testing

End-to-End Testing

Regression Testing

Performance and Compatibility Testing

Security Testing

Interruption Testing

✅ 2. Choose Tools and Frameworks
Cross-Platform Automation Tools:
Appium (most popular, supports for both Android/iOS)

Detox (for React Native)

Flutter Driver (Flutter apps)

XCUITest + Espresso (native frameworks for iOS & Android)

CI/CD Integration:
Use GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI to run automated tests on real devices/simulators.

✅ 3. Setup Testing Environments
Simulators/Emulators:
Android Emulator (Android Studio)

iOS Simulator (Xcode)

Real Device Testing:
Use device farms (e.g., BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, Firebase Test Lab) to test on a wide range of real devices.

✅ 4. Write Platform-Agnostic Tests (where possible)
Use common test code for shared functionality (with conditional logic if needed).

Keep platform-specific differences isolated.

✅ 5. Perform Manual Exploratory Testing
Validate gestures, push notifications, UI/UX elements.

Test platform-specific behaviors (e.g., back button on Android, swipe gestures on iOS).

✅ 6. Test Device Features
Ensure the app works well with:

Camera, GPS, Microphone, Sensors

Permissions and OS-level settings

Varying network conditions (airplane mode, 3G/4G/5G, no network)

✅ 7. Validate Across OS Versions & Devices
Test on multiple screen sizes and OS versions.

Focus on the most widely used Android devices and iPhone models.

✅ 8. Track and Report Bugs
Use bug tracking tools like Jira, TestRail, or Bugzilla.

Attach screenshots/videos/logs for faster resolution.

✅ 9. Continuously Monitor and Improve
Monitor crash logs via tools like Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry.

Collect user feedback and session recordings.
